MoreMigrationPaths
==================

This plugin adds the possibility to add more migration paths to rails. This is helpful if you want to split your migrations in multiple directories. You could have migrations in plugins or gems for example.

Usage
=====

Install with:

script/plugin install git://github.com/helle/more_migration_paths.git

After that just add something like this to an initializer:

ActiveRecord::Migrator.add_migration_path(File.join(RAILS_ROOT, 'lib', 'extra_migrations'))

The next time you do a db:migrate, your migrations in RAILS_ROOT/lib/extra_migrations will automatically be found and migrated.
