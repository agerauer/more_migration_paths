MoreMigrationPaths
==================

This Plugin adds the possibility to add more migration paths to rails. This is helpful if you want to split your migrations in multiple directories.

Example
=======

Just add something like this to an initializer:

ActiveRecord::Migrator.add_migration_path(File.join(RAILS_ENV, 'lib', 'extra_migrations'))
